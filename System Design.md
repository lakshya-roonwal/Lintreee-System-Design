### **High-Level System Design:**

1. **Client Interface:**
    - This is the web application where users interact with Linktree. It allows users to create and customize their Linktree profile, manage links, and view analytics.
    - Built using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with frameworks like React or Angular for dynamic user interfaces.
2. **Backend Services:**
    - Responsible for handling user authentication, profile management, link management, and analytics.
    - Built using a backend framework like Node.js, Django, or Flask.
    - Communicates with the database for storing and retrieving user data.
3. **Database:**
    - Stores user profiles, links, settings, and analytics data.
    - Can be a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB depending on scalability and data structure requirements.
4. **API Layer:**
    - Exposes RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication.
    - Handles requests for user authentication, profile management, link management, and analytics.
    - Implemented using REST principles and secured with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for authentication.
5. **Caching Layer:**
    - Implements caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce load on the database.
    - Utilizes technologies like Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data such as user profiles and links.
6. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
    - Serves static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files to users.
    - Improves page load times and reduces server load by distributing content across geographically distributed servers.

### **Low-Level System Design:**

1. **User Authentication:**
    - **Sign Up:**
        - Client sends a POST request to **`/signup`** endpoint with user's email, username, and password.
        - Server validates input data, hashes the password using bcrypt, and stores it in the database.
        - Upon successful registration, server responds with a success message or authentication token.
    - **Log In:**
        - User sends a POST request to **`/login`** endpoint with their email/username and password.
        - Server verifies credentials against stored data in the database.
        - If credentials are valid, server generates a JWT and sends it to the client for future authentication.
    - **Password Reset:**
        - User requests a password reset by sending a POST request to **`/password/reset`** endpoint with their email.
        - Server generates a unique reset token and sends it to the user's email address.
        - User clicks on the link provided in the email to access a password reset page where they can set a new password.
    - **Social Media Login:**
        - Client initiates authentication flow with the social media provider (e.g., Facebook, Google).
        - Once user authorizes the application, social media provider sends an access token to the client.
        - Client sends the access token to the server, which validates it with the social media provider.
        - If the token is valid, the server creates a new user account or logs in the existing user and returns a JWT to the client.
2. **Profile Management:**
    - **Profile Picture:**
        - User uploads a profile picture via a multipart/form-data POST request to **`/profile/picture`** endpoint.
        - Server saves the image to a designated storage location and updates the user's profile with the image URL.
    - **Bio:**
        - User updates their bio by sending a PATCH request to **`/profile/bio`** endpoint with the new bio text.
        - Server updates the user's profile with the new bio.
    - **Customization:**
        - User customizes their Linktree page by sending a PATCH request to **`/profile/customize`** endpoint with customization options.
        - Server updates the user's profile with the chosen customization settings.
    - **Retrieval:**
        - Client sends a GET request to **`/profile`** endpoint with the user's authentication token.
        - Server verifies the token and retrieves the user's profile data from the database.
        - Server sends the profile data back to the client for display.
3. **Link Management:**
    - **Add Link:**
        - User adds a new link by sending a POST request to **`/links`** endpoint with link details (title, URL).
        - Server validates the input data and adds the link to the user's profile.
    - **Edit Link:**
        - User updates a link by sending a PATCH request to **`/links/{linkId}`** endpoint with updated link details.
        - Server updates the link in the user's profile.
    - **Delete Link:**
        - User deletes a link by sending a DELETE request to **`/links/{linkId}`** endpoint.
        - Server removes the link from the user's profile.
    - **Retrieve Links:**
        - Client sends a GET request to **`/links`** endpoint with the user's authentication token.
        - Server retrieves the user's links from the database and sends them back to the client for display.
4. **Analytics:**
    - **Track Clicks:**
        - Server tracks clicks on links by incrementing a counter in the database whenever a link is clicked.
    - **Track Page Views:**
        - Server tracks page views by incrementing a counter in the database whenever a user visits a Linktree page.
    - **User Demographics:**
        - Server collects and stores user demographics (e.g., location, device type) during registration or through analytics tracking.
    - **Provide Insights:**
        - Server aggregates analytics data and provides insights to users through a dashboard or reports.
